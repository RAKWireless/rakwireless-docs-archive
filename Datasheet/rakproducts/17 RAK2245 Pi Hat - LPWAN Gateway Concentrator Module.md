### Product Description

**RAK2245 Pi HAT** is a module with Raspberry PI form factor. It can be plugged into
Raspberry PI such as Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ as a complete RF front end of gateway.It supports eight channels and is available for LoRaWAN® global frequency
bands. The board is the smallest g gateway concentrator which integrates the
**Ublox MAX-7Q GPS Module** and **heat sink**. 

The board can provide low data rate LoRa® radio links in ultra-fast speed. It is powered
by a Semtech SX1301 transceiver concentrator that is capable of managing packets
from many remotely dispersed end-points. Two Semtech SX125X are integrated for RF
front end I/Q transceivers. 

The RAK2245 Pi HAT is a complete and cost efficient gateway solution that can
help you develop a full LoRa® system. This is an economical way to create different
solutions like smart grid, intelligent farm and other IoT applications. It is also ideal for
manufacturing small series that can expand into more applications.
