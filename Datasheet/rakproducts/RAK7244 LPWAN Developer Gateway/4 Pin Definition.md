There are three (3) available configuration options for the RAK7244x:

1. **RAK7244**: Raspberry Pi 4 + RAK2245 Pi HAT
2. **RAK7244C**: Raspberry Pi 4 + RAK2245 Pi HAT + RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT
3. **RAK7244P**: Raspberry Pi 4 + RAK2245 Pi HAT + RAK9003 PoE HAT

### RAK9003 Pi Hat

The **RAK9003 Pi HAT** is a PoE (802.3 af) board, that is designed to be mounted on top of the 40-pin connector on a Raspberry Pi 3/4.

For further information, refer to [**RAK9003 PoE HAT Datasheet**](https://doc.rakwireless.com/datasheet/rakproducts/rak9003-poe-hat).

### RAK2013 Pi HAT

The RAK2013 is an add-on board based on the Raspberry Pi HAT standard that can transmit UART data from Raspberry Pi to the Cellular network. It supports several cellular protocols, such as **NB-IoT**, **CAT-M**, **CAT1**, or **CAT 4**, by choosing different modular on the board. The device is capable of integrating audio codec and audio amplifier along with the carrier operator's network, plus it supports Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) function. It is easy to use with the earphone connector, MIC connector, and speaker connector having an audio amplifier.
