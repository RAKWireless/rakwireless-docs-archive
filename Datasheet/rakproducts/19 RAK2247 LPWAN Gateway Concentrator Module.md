## Product Description

The **RAK2247 LPWAN Gateway Concentrator Module** is a LoRa® Concentrator module with mini-PCIe form factor based on the **SX1301**. This enables easy integration into routers and other networking equipment, adding LPWAN Gateway capabilities. The module can be used in any embedded platform offering a mini-PCIe slot with an **SPI or USB connection**.

Despite its small size, this is an 8 channel concentrator module. By integrating it together with a computing core a fully fledged gateway solution can easily be created.

## Product Features
