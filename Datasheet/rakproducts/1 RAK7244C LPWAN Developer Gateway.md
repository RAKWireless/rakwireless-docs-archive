### Product Description

The **RAK7244C LPWAN Developer Gateway** is a complete and cost efficient gateway Solution that will help you get started in developing a full LoRa® System. It is built with the RAK2245 Pi Hat stacked with the newest Raspberry Pi 4, along with the GPS module and Heat Sink, increasing its performance and thermal dissipation, plus an optional RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT. The housing for the device is durable and entirely built from aluminum.

The gateway has a powerful LoRa® digital signal processing engine from Semtech SX1301 RF front end chip. It is capable of receiving up to 8 LoRa® packets simultaneously sent with different spreading factors on different channels. It is available in multiple variants to be accessible in all LoRa Alliance® frequency bands. This breakthrough allows innovative network architecture to be implemented that has a huge impact over other short range systems. The cellular function of the gateway having RAK2013 gives way to more M2M and IoT applications.

Overall, this gateway has various functionalities that are ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstrations and evaluation on future deployment scenarios. With its ready to use Raspbian based firmware, it is now possible to connect the Gateway to any standard LoRaWAN® Server. The device is capable of tackling applications related to Smart Grids, Intelligent Farms and other IoT Enterprise applications.
