### Product Description

The RAK5802 module is part of the WisBlock series, specifically, it is one of the modules that belongs to the WisIO category. This module was designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way, and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module. 

The RAK5802 is a RS485 ModBus extension module that allows users to provide IoT connectivity to a new/existing solution with RS485 interface. This module converts the RS485 signals into UART signals. These signals are collected by a MCU located inside of a WisCore module for further data transmission. 

The RAK5802 module features one RS485 interface. Inside, a protection circuity is added to protect against ESD hazard. The RAK5802 module complies with the  IEC61000-4-2 standard and can protect up to 18 KV HBM ESD.

In addition, the RAK5802 supports one I2C interface, customer can use this I2C interface to connect external sensors. 

### Product Features

- Supports one RS485 interface and ModBus.
- Supports WisIO interface. It is compatible with multiple WisCore modules, such as RAK4201.
- Supports up to 16 RS485 nodes
- Supports TX/RX signals automatic detection, no need to have DE signal for the RS485 chip.
- Supports low power consumption mode. The module can be powered off by the WisCore module for saving energy during idle periods.
- Reserved I2C expansion interface.
- Supports in the field fast crimping terminals.
- Designed with 18kV ESD protection level.
- Small dimensions of 35mm x 25mm.
