### Product Description

RAK811 Low-Power Long Range LoRa® Technology Transceiver module provides an easy to
use, small size, low-power solution for long range wireless data transmission. 

The RAK811 module complies with the latest LoRaWAN® Class A & C protocol
specifications, it is simple to access LWPA IOT platforms, such Actility etc. It also supports LoRa® Point to Point communications (P2P) , this function can help customers implement their own
private long range LoRa® network fast.

The RAK811 Module is integrated with Semtech's SX1276 and STM32L which offers user a way communicating with AT Commands through UART Interface. Users will also be able to make their projects turn into reality such as Long Range Sensor data applications, RAK811 also offers a low power feature that is suitable for battery powered applications.
