Figure 1 below shows the minimum application schematic of the RAK833 LPWAN Gateway Concentrator Module which uses at least **3.3V/1A DC power source**. It can either connect through the SPI interface or USB interface to the main processor. If the SPI interface is chosen, **SPDT_SEL** should be connected to the ground (GND) otherwise, leave the pin open.
