The Interfaces of the RAK7246G are as shown in Figure 2. The TF card slot is used for the SD card that houses the Firmware (based on Raspbian OS). You have two SMA connectors for the LoRaÂ® and GPS antennas. There are 3 ports on the side, which are part of the Raspberry Pi Zero W board, which from left to right are: mini HDMI, USB MicroB, and another USB MicroB/Power (please only use this to power the device with the included adapter or an equivalent one).
