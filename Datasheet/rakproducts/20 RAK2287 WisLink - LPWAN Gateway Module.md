### Product Background

**RAK2287** is an LPWAN Concentrator Module with mini-PCIe form factor based on **Semtech SX1302**, which enables an easy integration into an existing router or other network equipment with LPWAN Gateway capabilities. It can be used in any embedded platform offering a free mini-PCIe slot with SPI connection.
In addition to the LPWAN functionality the module comes with a **ZOE-M8Q GPS chip,** in order to provide GNSS functionality.

This module is an exceptional, complete and cost efficient gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths, an 8 x 8 channel LoRa® packet detector, 8 x SF5-SF12 LoRa® demodulators and 8 x SF5-SF10  LoRa® demodulators. It is capable of detecting uninterrupted combination of packets at 8 different spreading factors and 10 channels with continuous demodulation of up to 16 packets. 
The module is well suited for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, that require node density of up to  500 nodes per km² in an environment with moderate interference.

### Product Features

- Designed with size efficiency in mind **(mPCIe** form factor).
- Built around the newly released **SX1302** base band processor.
- Compatible with **3G/LTE** card of mPCIe type  (**3.3V power domain**).
- Tx power up to **27dBm**, Rx sensitivity down to **-139dBm@SF12**, BW 125 kHz.
- **LoRaWAN® 1.0.2** compatible.
- **LoRa® band** coverage (RU864, IN865, EU868, US915, AU915,  KR920, AS923). 
- Built-in **ZOE-M8Q GPS** module
