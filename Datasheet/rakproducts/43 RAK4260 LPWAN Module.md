### Product Description

The **RAK4260 module** is based on **Microchip’s ATSAMR34J18B**. It is a SiP device integrating a 32-bit ARM Cortex -M0+ MCU with a LoRa® Transceiver in a 15 millimeter x 15 millimeter compact package.

The SAMR chip provides a number of highly configurable peripherals (configurable as I2C/SPI/UART interfaces). There are 12-bit ADC in addition to the aforementioned.

It is a perfect solution for any LoRaWAN® end node developer. The integration of the MCU and LoRa® Transceiver reduces size and minimizes costs. Having such a compact solution within a single package reduces time to market and allows for rapid development and deployment for a number of scenarios.

RAK4260 is a solution that is cost efficient and flexible that can be deployed in a wide variety of IoT scenarios that require the long range connectivity and great battery life that LoRaWAN® provides.
