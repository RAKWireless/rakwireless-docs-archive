The combination of the BME680 environmental unit and the LoRa radio make this device
especially suite for deploying sensor networks of large size in tall buildings or warehouses,
for example. 

When used in conjunction with one of the RAKwireless Gateways, as for example the
RAK7258 indoor Gateway, deploying a LoRaWAN sensor network becomes a breeze. One
just needs to mount the nodes on a wall or the ceiling, power them on and start monitoring
the working conditions of the factory/office. 

Furthermore, as all RAKwireless Industrial Gateways (including the aforementioned
RAK7258) come with built-in LoRaServer the time from deploying the Gateways and nodes
to having a functioning LoRaWAN network can be further reduced. There is no need to have
a LoRa Networks Server deployed separately, however if one chooses an integration can be
created via MQTT at any time. 

Thus, the solution is both incredibly quick an easy to deploy initially, and also allows for
scaling as the number of nodes grows and application requirements change. The aforementioned combination of RAK7204 and RAK7258 is visualized in Figure 1.
