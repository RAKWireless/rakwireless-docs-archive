## Product Background

**RAK7431** is an **RS485 to LoRaWAN® converter** designed for industrial applications. The device relays ModBUS data using the LoRaWAN® network as means of wirelessly transmitting to and from the end devices.

RAK7431 operates in all LoRaWAN® bands within the standard parameters defined by the LoRa® Alliance. It has an open environment range of 15+km while in industrial cases, where there are heavy obstructions in the path of the RF signal, performance is improved compared to conventional wireless systems with LoRa® as a modulation technique. This allows for consistently good signal quality within the confines of large factories, densely populated offices, storehouses, etc.

This RS485 compatible devices can address up to 16 client terminal nodes. The conversion from and to LoRa® frames is seamless and allows real time control, monitoring of multiple RS485 devices, bus data to access and control the RS485 terminal nodes.

RAK7431 together with RAK's Gateway and LoRa® Server products, can easily and quickly build a wireless industrial field control system. 

RAK7431 adopts industrial protection design, supports wide range voltage supply, supports wall mounting and DIN rail installation, facilitates field installation and use.
