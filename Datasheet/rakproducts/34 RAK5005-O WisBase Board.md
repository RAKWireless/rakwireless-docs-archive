## WisBlock Overview

**WisBlock modules** are part of a series of stackable boards built by RAKWireless for the IoT industry. WisBlock modules support dozens type of CPUs, sensors, and interface circuit boards. This concept allows customers to build their own electronic solutions very quickly, using building blocks to materialize their new ideas. Also, through high-speed connectors and easily attachable interconnections, customers will be able to composite reliable industrial products.

WisBlock series modules are divided into four: **WisBase module**, **WisDuo module**, **WisSensor module**, and **WisIO module**.

**RAK5005-O** module falls in the category of WisBase module. It is a **motherboard of WisBlock** that allow to attach a CPU, sensor, and IO modules through the standardized expansion connectors. These connectors provide a data bus interconnection between the modules attached to the baseboard. Also, the WisBase module integrates the power supply circuitry for battery charging, USB ports, indicator LEDs, buttons, and extended IO interfaces.

WisDuo module is the core computing and wireless connectivity unit within the WisBlock series. It integrates an MCU, a LoRa, a BLE, and other wireless transceiver modules in a single package. The data collected by sensors are processed by the MCU and sent to the cloud through LoRa wireless links. The BLE interface can also be used for short-range communication and indoor positioning function.

The WisSensor module integrates **MEMS sensors** of different types. Each WisBase base board can support up to four WisSensor modules. Customers can combine different types of sensors for their specific solutions. Sensors on WisSensor are designed for low power consumption to extend battery life.

WisIO module adds more flexibility to customers’ solutions. It expands various application interfaces, such as industrial sensor interface, display interface, industrial communication protocol extension, buttons, and LED indicators, which can be quickly implemented with a WisIO module.

If the above is not enough to cover all the customers’ IoT requirements, WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture. Therefore, users can also use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop their specific function modules. Basing on the standard of WisBlock, customers can quickly develop their own products to meet the specific needs in different industries.

WisBlock series boards are not only a good choice for functional prototyping during the development and verification stages, but also allows the customers to create a reliable and stable industrial level of products for mass production.

WisBlock uses a compact and stackable hardware design, which integrates various computing, connectivity, and sensor circuits within a size of 60*30mm. The compact size makes it easy for users to build in various customized housings to achieve complete products. RAK also has a series of housings for WisBlock modules, which can meet the requirements of various protection levels.

But WisBlock series modules are not only for the rapid implementation of engineering prototypes but also designed for massive production-ready applications. The modules can be used together with RAK industrial protective housing to create products ready for industrial environments. Under the unified management of WisDM, a complete end-to-end IoT solution is formed by aggregating data of wireless nodes through the RAK industrial gateways.

### WisBlock Architecture

WisBlock is designed for modularity, in the Figure 3, the whole ecosystem is depicted. The objective of the architecture is to allow the customers to combine different modules to create their own specific solution. A roadmap about the availability of the modules is also shown.
