### RAK5802 Mounting Mechanism

The RAK5802 module is part of the WisIO category, which connects to the base board through the WisIO slot. The installation method is shown in the Figure 2.

- First, keep the RAK5802 module parallel to the base board, and gently place its WisConnector and plug it into the WisIO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The WisIO slot has an outer silkscreen on it to assist the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process. For detailed instructions, please refer to the "WisBlock Installation Guide.pdf".

### RAK5802 Sensor Connector Crimping Mechanism

The RAK5802 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The crimping terminal can support cable with a diameter between 24 AWG and 20 AWG. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7 mm. 

As shown in the Figure 4, during crimping process, the user should first press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly, then insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connectorâ€™s hole. Once inserted correctly, then release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.
