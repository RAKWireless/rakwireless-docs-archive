### Mounting Mechanism

The RAK5801 module is part of the WisIO category, which connects to the baseboard through the _WisIO_ slot. To install the module, execute the following steps:

1.Keep the RAK5801 module **parallel to the baseboard**. Gently place its WisConnector and plug it into the WisIO slot receptacle of the baseboard. The WisIO slot has an outer silkscreen on it to assist the alignment. At this point, apply force evenly along with the module and press again. There will be a sound to confirm the successful completion of the attachment process.

### Sensor Connector Crimping Mechanism

The RAK5801 features a fast-crimping terminal connector to simplify and ensure the wiring process on the fields. The crimping terminal can support cable with a width between **24AWG** and **20 AWG**. The usual stripping length is around 6 to 7 mm. 

Execute the following steps of the crimping process:

1.Press down and maintain the spring head of the crimping terminal firmly. 

2.Insert the stripped cable head into the corresponding connectorâ€™s hole. Once inserted correctly, release the spring head, and the crimping process is completed.
