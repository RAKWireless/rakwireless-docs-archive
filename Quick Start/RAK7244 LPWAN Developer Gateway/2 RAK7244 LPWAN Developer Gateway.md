### Product Background

The **RAK7244 - LPWAN Developer Gateway** is a complete and cost efficient Gateway Solution that will help you get started in developing a full LoRa® System. It is built with the **RAK2245 Pi Hat** stacked with the newest **Raspberry Pi 4**, along with the GPS module and Heat Sink, increasing its performance and thermal dissipation. The housing for the device is durable and entirely built from aluminum.

The Gateway has a powerful LoRa® digital signal processing engine from Semtech SX1301 RF front end chip. It is capable of receiving up to 8 LoRa® packets simultaneously sent with different spreading factors on different channels. It is available in multiple variants to be accessible in all LoRa Alliance® frequency bands. This breakthrough allows innovative network architectures to be implemented that has a huge impact over other short range systems. 

Overall, this Gateway has various functionalities that are ideal for prototyping, proof-of-concept demonstrations and evaluation on future deployment scenarios. With its ready to use Raspbian based firmware, it is now possible to connect the Gateway to any standard LoRaWAN® Server. The device is capable of tackling applications related to Smart Grids, Intelligent Farms and other IoT Enterprise applications.
