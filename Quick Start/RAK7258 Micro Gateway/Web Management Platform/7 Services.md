## 1. Dynamic DNS (Beta)

Dynamic DNS allows your router to be reached via a fixed host name while having a dynamically changing IP address.

    }
}]$

$plugin[{
    "type": "callout",
    "data": {
        "text": "Make sure to go through the **Hints** in order to get some understanding of how Dynamic DNS functions as a whole. You can do this by clicking on the \u201c**Show more**\u201d text in the Hints field.",
        "type": "info",
        "title": "Note:"
    }
}]$

### Overview

To change the global settings press on the text "**To change global settings click here**" that is marked in the red rectangle in Figure 1. This will affect DDNS as a whole (both IPv4 and IPv6 for example).

If you want to have separate settings/rules for IPv4/IPv6, you need to define two sets, one for each. You can do this by filling in a name in the text box and pressing the “**Add**” button.

An IPv4 example is created by default and you only need to configure its parameters by pressing the “**Edit**” button.
