    "data": {
        "text": "To avoid errors in the firmware compiling using the RUI Online Compiler, it is best advised to use Google Chrome as your Web Browser as this was the browser our technical team used upon testing. If you have not installed the Google Chrome browser, kindly download and install it from **[here](https:\/\/www.google.com\/chrome\/)**.",
