### Product Background

The **RAK7243C LPWAN Developer Gateway** is a complete and cost efficient gateway Solution that will help you get started in developing a full LoRa速 System. It is built with the RAK2245 Pi Hat stacked with the Raspberry Pi 3B+ along with the GPS module and Heat Sink, increasing its performance and thermal dissipation, plus a RAK2013 Cellular Pi HAT for cellular connectivity. The housing for the device is durable and entirely built from aluminum.

The RAK7243C LPWAN Developer Gateway is ideal for prototyping, proof-of concept evaluation and demonstration. It includes everything you need to help you get started in building your own LoRaWAN速 Network in just a couple of minutes.  It provides great value and flexible functionality for a variety of applications: Smart Grids, Intelligent Farming and other IoT applications.
