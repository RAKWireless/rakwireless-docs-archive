**S tep 1**: Install the bolts in the holes, which are circled in red in Figure 1. Tighten the nuts and make sure that the rails that make up the base are holding tight against each other. 

This will make an “H” shaped base, for the Solar Panel to be mounted on top off. The circular pipe in the middle of the shape is mean to fit over a circular shaped pole, so the whole construction sits on top with the panel facing upwards, on an angle.

**Step 2**:
Mount the battery on top of the two parallel rails in the middle. Make sure it
is as close as possible to the middle of the construction. Fasten it to the
rails with four bolts, each having a washer and a nut. Tighten well, as the
battery is quite heavy. Refer to
the Figure 2 on
how to insert the bolts into the railing that is part of the bottom of the battery
casing.

    }
}]$

**Step 3**:
Connect the power cable coming out of the input port of the Battery to the
screw terminals on the back of the Solar Panel. Make sure not to reverse
the  polarity. Figure 3 shows
the connection on the back of the Solar Panel.

Figure 4 shows where the cable from the Solar
Panel enters the input terminal on the Battery.

**S tep 4**: Connect the battery output terminal cable to the power cable coming from the input of the Gateway as shown in Figure 5.

    }
}]$

**S tep 5:** Mount the whole installation you have assembled so far on top of a circular pole. Put the panel facing up and insert the pole in the pipe opening on the bottom of the construction. Make sure the pole is of a sufficiently small diameter to fit **(65mm recommended)**. Use **6xM8** bolts to secure the pole and the  pipe together (the pole needs to have been drilled beforehand) as shown in Figure 6
