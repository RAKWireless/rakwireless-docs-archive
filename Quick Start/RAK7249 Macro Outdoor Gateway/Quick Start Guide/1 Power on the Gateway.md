1.**Attach the antennas**

First and foremost screw on the antennas. All 5 of them should be installed (**WiFi**, **LoRa**Â®, **LTE-DIV**, **LTE-MAIN** on the top, and **GPS** on the bottom) same with the image shown below.

}]$

2.**Power on the Gateway**

It is recommended to use a **CAT5 Cable** to provide power to the Gateway. Attach one end to the **PoE injector** and the other to the **Ethernet Port** on the bottom of the casing.
