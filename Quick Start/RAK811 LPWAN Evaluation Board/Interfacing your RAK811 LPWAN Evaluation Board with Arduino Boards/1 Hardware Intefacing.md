In this document, we will be using an Arduino MEGA 2560 and RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board. Follow the steps thoroughly; any negligence might end up damaging your hardwares.

    "type": "callout",
    "data": {
        "text": "As of now, our RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board only works with Arduino Mega 2560. Watch out for our future revisions for you to interface it with other Arduino boards.",

}]$

1.To start with, we are going to differentiate the existing RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Boards or as named in the boards as WisNode-LoRaÂ®.
