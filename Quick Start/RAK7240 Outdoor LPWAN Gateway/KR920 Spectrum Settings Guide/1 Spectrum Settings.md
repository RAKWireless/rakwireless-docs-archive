Let us take as an example the **KR920-923 frequency band**. When accessing the Web Management Platform, there is a template for it that you can
import directly which would not need to set every channel manually. However, the way it has been configured is in accordance with principles that apply for any band.

**1**.Sett the Center Frequencies for the two Radios

| **RX Channels** | **Frequency** (Hz) | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| **Radio 0** Center Frequency | 922500000 (922.5 MHz) | 
| **Radio 1** Center Frequency | 923300000 (923.3 MHz) | 


**2**.Set the **Minimum** and **Maximum** frequency range of Radio

| **TX Channels** | **Frequency** (Hz) |

| **Radio 0** Tx Minimum Frequency | 920000000 (920 MHz) | 
| **Radio 1** Tx Maximum Frequency | 925000000 (925 MHz) | 


## Selecting the Radios/Channels

Let us have a summary of the parameters that can be seen in the image below, which is below the Radio
0 and Radio 1 frequency fields we talked about in the previous section.

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1583243862\/26654\/pwenc52bfclibgpsxlz2.png",

    }
}]$

The same summary applies to Concentrator Module 1 in the image below:

    }
}]$

| **Chain. ID** | Unique identifier of the channel (8 Multi-SF Channels, 1 LoRa Standard, 1 FSK) | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| **Enable** | Slider for turning a channel on/off | 
| **Radio** | The Radio the channel will be assigned to (max 5 per Radio) | 
| **If** [Hz] | The frequency offset from the center frequency for the given channel | 
| **Freq** [Hz] | The resulting frequency for the channel after summing the center frequency with the __If__ field value | 
| **Bandwidth** [KHz] | This is only selectable for the LoRa® Standard and FSK channels. The MultiSF are static | 
| **Datarate** | Essentially this is the **Spreading Factor (SF)** as it is directly related to the bitwise data rate. The MultiSF channels can dynamically use any of the available SFs (SF7 – SF12). The Standard LoRa® channel has to have a single value assigned (SF7 - SF12). The FSK channel has a field with a numeric value to be entered in **bps**. In order to have each channel at the desired frequency the user needs to set the appropriate offset from the central frequency. This way you can end up with a number of channels spread above and below the center frequency | 


## Setting the Frequency Offset

In Accordance with the [LoRa Alliance Regional Parameters Documentation](https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/lorawantm_regional_parameters_v1.1rb_-_final.pdf), we have the
following two frequency sub-bands, where channels 1, 2, and 3 are the default ones and need
to be available in any equipment using the band.

### Sub-Band 1

**Uplink**:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 1. | **922.1** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 2. | **922.3** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 3. | **922.5** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 4. | **922.7** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 5. | **922.9** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 6. | **923.1** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 7. | **923.3** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 


**Downlink**:

- Uplink channels 1-9 (RX1)

### Sub-Band 2

**Uplink**:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 8. | **920.9** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 9. | **921.1** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 10. | **921.3** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 11. | **921.5** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 12. | **921.7** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| 13. | **921.9** - SF7BW125 to SF12BW125 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 


**Downlink**:

- Uplink channels 1-9 (RX1)

With the Frequency Plan provided by [LoRa Alliance](https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/lorawantm_regional_parameters_v1.1rb_-_final.pdf), it is now easy to see why we have chosen the values shown in **Figure 1** and **Figure 2**. Two (2) things should be taken into account.

- We need to cover the whole spectrum for the **Uplink**, from the lowest to the highest frequency.
- Additionally, we need to have the 5 channels per radio to be as close as possible with each other. So, we would group the Radios by frequency and not by number of channels.

For the aforementioned reason, **channels 1,2,3,4,** and **5** should be assigned to the **first Radio (Radio 0).**The **second Radio (Radio 1)** can get the other two **channels 6**, and
**7**.

Now, in order to keep the bandwidth tight, we pick a channel in each of the two Radio ranges
as close as possible to the middle. Ideally, as we have five channels (Radio 0), this would be the 3rd one. The **center frequency channels** are then **channels 3** and **7**. This leads us to the center frequencies
that are in **Figure 1**. As for the Downlink, we simply need to cover the whole band, in this case
920 MHz to 925 MHz.

## Offset Frequency Calculation

Now we can start calculating the frequency offset we need to have from the center frequency
for each channel. We will use the following formula:

$plugin[{
    "type": "callout",
    "data": {
        "text": "**If** = **MultiSF** - **Radio Freq**",
        "type": "info",
        "title": "Equation:"
    }
}]$

### Concentrator Module 0

**RADIO 0**:

**MultiSF 0** = CH 1 = 922100000 Hz

- If 0 = MultiSF 0 - Radio 0 Freq = 922100000 – 922500000 = -400000 Hz

**MultiSF 1** = CH 2 = 922300000 Hz

- If 1 = MultiSF 1 - Radio 0 Freq = 922300000 – 922500000 = -200000 Hz

**MultiSF 2** = CH 3 = 922500000 Hz

- If 2 = MultiSF 2 - Radio 0 Freq = 922500000 – 922500000 = 0 Hz

**MultiSF 3** = CH 4 = 922700000 Hz

- If 3 = MultiSF 3 - Radio 0 Freq = 922700000 – 922500000 = 200000 Hz

**MultiSF 4** = CH 5 = 922900000 Hz

- If 4 = MultiSF 4 - Radio 0 Freq = 922900000 – 922500000 = 400000 Hz

**RADIO 1**:

**MultiSF 5** = CH 6 = 923100000 Hz

- If 5 = MultiSF 5 - Radio 1 Freq = 923100000 Hz – 923300000 = -200000 Hz

**MultiSF 6** = CH 7 = 923300000 Hz

- If 6 = MultiSF 6 - Radio 1 Freq = 923300000 Hz – 923300000 = 0 Hz

Finally we have all the If frequency values and we only need plug them in the fields to get the
TTN KR920-923 frequency plan.

### Concentrator Module 1

**RADIO 0**:

**MultiSF 0** = CH 1 = 920900000 Hz

- If 0 = MultiSF 0 - Radio 0 Freq = 920900000 – 921100000 = -200000 Hz

**MultiSF 1** = CH 2 = 921100000 Hz

- If 1 = MultiSF 1 - Radio 0 Freq = 921100000 – 921100000 = 0 Hz

**MultiSF 2** = CH 3 = 921300000 Hz

- If 2 = MultiSF 2 - Radio 0 Freq = 921300000 – 921100000 = 200000 Hz

**RADIO 1**:

**MultiSF 3** = CH 4 = 921500000 Hz

- If 3 = MultiSF 3 - Radio 1 Freq = 921500000 – 921700000 = -200000 Hz

**MultiSF 4** = CH 5 = 921700000 Hz

- If 4 = MultiSF 4 - Radio 1 Freq = 921700000 – 921700000 = 0 Hz

**MultiSF 5** = CH 6 = 922900000 Hz

- If 5 = MultiSF 5 - Radio 1 Freq = 921900000 – 921700000 = 200000 Hz

$plugin[{
    "type": "callout",
    "data": {
        "text": "Remember Band 1 is limited to 14 dBm maximum output power, Band 2 is limited to\n10 dBm. The maximum downlink power of the RAK7240 Outdoor LPWAN Gateway is 23 dBm.",
        "type": "info",
        "title": "Note:"
    }
}]$

This concludes setting up the two Radios with the appropriated frequencies, bandwidths and
data rates.
