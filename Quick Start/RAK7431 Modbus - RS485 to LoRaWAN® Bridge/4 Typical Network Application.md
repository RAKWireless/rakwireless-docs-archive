RAK7431 converts data from the RS485 protocol into LPWAN wireless messages and delivers it to a cloud server through an LPWAN gateway. Cloud servers can also proactively send data to RAK7431 for two-way data transmission. Using the RAK7431, you can convert data from a conventional RS485 wired network to a wireless network.
