In this section, we will be connecting the RAK612 LoRa Button to The Things Network (TTN). If you don't have an account yet, head on to [https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and create one. Once done, Log in to your account and go to the console which can be found here:

- Choose "**APPLICATIONS**"

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561811405\/16624\/roy08v9xb2mjhjubu9pb.jpg",

    }
}]$

## Adding an Application

- Then, Click the "**add application**" button

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561811607\/16624\/tcayyzitgznhhn3iuvjo.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",

        "height": 786,
        "caption": "**Figure 4:** Adding an Application"
    }
}]$

Here are the things that you should take note in adding an application:

1. **Application ID** - this will be the unique id of your application in the Network. Please note that characters should be in lower case.
2. **Description** - this is a short and concise human readable description of your application.
3. **Application EUI** - this will be generated automatically by The Things Network for convenience. 
4. **Handler Registration** - handler you want to register this application to.

- After you fill in the necessary information, press the "**Add application**" button at the bottom of this page. If you see the following page, this means that you have successfully registered your application.

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561811914\/16624\/gennkfygvsawezaey88z.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1799,
        "height": 782,
        "caption": "**Figure 5:** Application Overview"
    }
}]$

### Register Device

- Scroll down until you see the Devices section, or you can also click the "**Devices**" button at the top:

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561812052\/16624\/qexdiczhmwmucsjqzjsj.png",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1799,
        "height": 782,
        "caption": null
    }
}]$

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561812148\/16624\/atqen9yqhy2ielaooqzi.png",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1117,
        "height": 214,
        "caption": "**Figure 6:** Device Section"
    }
}]$

- Click "**Register device "**

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561812216\/16624\/s4yxv5hfqemcpeotnmg2.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1789,
        "height": 783,
        "caption": "**Figure 7:** Add your Device"
    }
}]$

Here are the things that you should take note in registering your device:

1. **Device ID** - this is the unique identifier for your RAK612 LoRa Button in your application. You need to enter this manually.
2. **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for your device in the network. You can change it later, if you want.

Click the following icon and the Device EUI will be automatically generated by the TTN. 

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561815848\/16624\/gpxablfhj5ugmiyofnpr.png",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1793,
        "height": 871,
        "caption": "**Figure 8:** Auto Generate the Device EUI"
    }
}]$

- If you use an automatically generated EUI you need to configure it in your RAK612.

Using RAK's Serial Port Tool that was discussed in the [auto$](/rak612-lora-button/installing-the-firmware#testing-the-installed-firmware) section, you can set the Device ID of your RAK612 LoRa Button.

Select the COM Port for your RAK612 LoRa Button, Open the COM Port and input the following  AT command
(xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx stands for your desired EUI):
`at+set_config=dev_eui:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561985307\/16624\/pg1matr7lkqottyzwwin.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 566,
        "height": 976,
        "caption": "**Figure 9:** Set the Dev_EUI"
    }
}]$

- If you want to provide your own EUI to use in TTN, you need to extract it from the RAK612 (or alternately set the same one in TTN and the RAK612)

Using RAK's Serial Port Tool that was discussed in the [auto$](/rak612-lora-button/installing-the-firmware#testing-the-installed-firmware) section, you can get the Device ID of your RAK612 LoRa Button.

Select the COM Port for your RAK612 LoRa Button, Open the COM Port and input the following AT command:
`at+get_config=dev_eui`

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561986639\/16624\/xc5q6vwgqlyczh3pmfcw.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 568,
        "height": 957,
        "caption": "**Figure 8:** Getting your Setting ID"
    }
}]$

- Lastly , click the "**Register**" button at the bottom of the page.

$plugin[{
    "type": "image",
    "data": {
        "url": "https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/developerhub\/image\/upload\/v1561815935\/16624\/riupvzzzgtdzuyb9doxd.jpg",
        "mode": "responsive",
        "width": 1788,
        "height": 879,
        "caption": "**Figure 10:** Device Overview"
    }
}]$

In the next section, we will configure show how to configure the device using OTAA and ABP, respectively.
