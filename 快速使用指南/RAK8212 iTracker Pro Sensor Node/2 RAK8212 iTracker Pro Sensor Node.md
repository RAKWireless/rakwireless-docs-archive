## Product Background

**iTracker Pro RAK8212** is versatile developer board aimed at aiding in quick prototypes using [Narrowband Internet of Things (NB IOT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT). The board includes a vast array of connectivity options  such as NB IoT, [Bluetooth 5 (BLE 5.0)](https://www.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-resources/bluetooth-5-go-faster-go-further/) and GPS, and sensors like an accelerometer , a light sensor and a barometric sensor. At the heart of the module is the venerable [Nordic nRF52832 BLE ](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52832)processor. The NB IoT connectivity is provided by the Quectel BG96 module. The RAK8212 module is Arduino friendly and can be programmed using the IDE. The board also provides [Serial Wire Debug (SWD)](https://www.silabs.com/community/mcu/32-bit/knowledge-base.entry.html/2014/10/21/serial_wire_debugs-qKCT) interface for programming the nRF52832 core. The combination of BLE and NB IoT provides flexible low power consumption development along with myriad of application option ranging from telemetry to live tracking and environment sensing. With RAK8212 tracker board the sky is the limit for your ideas.
