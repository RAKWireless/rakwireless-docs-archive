## Product Background

The Enterprise Grade DIY outdoor Gateway is an ideal product for IoT commercial
deployment. It contains the Main Board, Operator-grade waterproof enclosure, backup
battery and mounting accessories. The hardware main board completely integrates the
**WIFI**, **4G**, **GPS** and **PoE main supply** with an **integrated back-up battery**. The firmware
implements a fully featured LoRaWAN™ compliant network base station. The
Gateway has a range of over **15 Kilometer line-of-sight** and over **2 Kilometer in dense urban
environments**. 

The DIY Gateway brings more flexibility for the developer to create an enterprise grade
solution: our most important difference is our flexible development support structure, allowing for faster development and time to market. We offer both a ready-to-go
firmware image for openWRT based platforms and an open SDK for integration into
hardware to support the needs of each customer
